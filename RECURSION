//DAY--1-->LEARNING RECURSION


1---> BASIC RECURSION FUNCTIONS
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void fun(int x){
    if(x==100){
        return;
    }
    cout<<1<<endl;
    x++;
}
int main(){
    return fun(55);
}
//IT WILL PRINT 1 UNTILL X DID NOT BECOME 100


2-->WHEN RECURSION CALL IS DONE IT PUT ALL ITS CALL ON STACK IN SYNCHRONIZE WAY ----> 
if recursion with no base condition is performed then it will produce the result and at last it will give the segmentation fault
as the stack as limited storage capacity and it will get fully utilised
